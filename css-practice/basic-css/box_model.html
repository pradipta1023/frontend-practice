        <p>
          We are currently in the middle of the group stages. Twenty teams are
          battling it out in four groups of five. Only the top two from each
          group will advance to the Super 8 stage.

          <h3 class="headings">Group A: The "Group of Death"</h3>

          <p>
            Group A features India, Pakistan, New Zealand, and two qualifiers.
            It is currently the tightest group in the tournament.
          </p>

          <p class="para-margin">
            India is currently leading the table due to a superior Net Run Rate,
            but the upcoming match against Pakistan will likely decide who tops
            the group.
